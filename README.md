# Flask-API-
The dataset used contains sports statistics on rookie NBA players. The goal is to provide a classifier to predict that a player is worth investing in him because he will last more than 5 years in the NBA based on his sports statistics. This model is aimed at an advisor to investors seeking to capitalize on future NBA talent.

The classifier is inserted as a unit query in a web service. The web service in REST API format takes all the relevant parameters as input, as if it were made available to a user wanting to make a request on a single player.
